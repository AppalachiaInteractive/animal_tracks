# Animal Tracks
A collection of graphics and images of animal tracks.  No attribution is required, do what you like.  I would love to see anything that you produce, though!

## Included
- SVG files of the track outline
- PNG files of the track silhouette
- PNG files of *my estimation* of the track's surface details, such as displacement and surface normals.  

## Status
The table below will be updated as I finish each track.

- :heavy_check_mark: == completed
- :x: == will not do
- no symbol == in progress

## Background
These are not scans - everything was derived from the reference image above so they may not line up 100% with real world tracks.  Feel free to make pull requests if you improve or add something, or raise issues if you would like an animal added or modified.  If you can provide the track silhouette or outline, even better.  No guarantees but I'll do what I can.

The original reference image is included with the repository, as well as a few cleaned up versions.  The original appears to be a scan from a book, and has been shared hundreds of times across the internet.  I can not find the original source, but if you know it I would appreciate being able to cite it here.
